# 378-unity
This repository is for Lab 3 and Lab 4 in CSC 378 using Unity.

Follow these directions to set up the project: 

1) Checkout project using you're favorite version controls system (i.e. SourceTree)

2) Open your Unity project while holding down the Option or the left Alt key. This will force Unity to recreate the Library directory (this step might not be necessary since I've seen Unity recreating the Library directory even if you don't hold down any key).

3) A git ignore file has been created to manage the version control of the project.

4) Have fun! And add TONS of assets :)
